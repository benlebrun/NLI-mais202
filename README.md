# NLI-mais202
MAIS 202 final project. In this repo, I fine-tuning BERT on the MNLI dataset and then test on HANS, a heuristic analysis data set. Overall, the model acheives 84% accuracy on MNLI, but performs very poorly on HANS, indicating that the model may develop syntactic heuristics during training.
